1. Toothpaste
- Hopins, great ads (example of with live steam)
- WW1 problems, WW2 teath okay
- clear cues and triggers, the film on tooth


2. Crawing
P&G invention of smell remover, smokers pet owners, how they were super data driven but it still  failed,

the point that people who need it the most don't recognize they need it


3. Monkeys
experiment where craving was found, expercting a reward, waiting for craving, Cibbaon example, smoking checking phone examples. good habit examples

4. P&G success
watching footages, understanding getting happy when finishing and rebraning FeBreze as nice little touch to make smell better, irony that now it's a odor and not odor remover, 

5. Hopkins realiszation
Hopkins formula was used before as well, but the toothpaste worked because the oils created a tinglinging sensation, which became a crave and you can notice if you forgot to brush teeth

example of shampoos adding foam, and tootbrashes as well
