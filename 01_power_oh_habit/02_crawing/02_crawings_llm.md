1. Toothpaste

- Claude Hopkins: master advertiser (e.g., “live steam” for Schlitz, Cleopatra for Palmolive) who turned everyday products into habits.
- Context: WWI exposed widespread tooth decay; by the 1930s–40s, daily brushing had become common.
- Cue: naturally occurring “film” (mucin plaque) on teeth—ads asked people to run their tongue over teeth to feel it.
- Reward: beauty and a “Pepsodent smile,” making brushing a daily ritual.
- Message worked even though film is removable by simple friction (apple, rinsing); the ad created a daily trigger.
- Result: adoption soared (from ~7% with toothpaste to ~65% in a decade); by WWII, soldiers brushed daily.

2. Craving

- P&G invented Febreze (HPBCD) to remove—not mask—odors for smokers, pet owners, etc.
- Initial campaigns stalled: people closest to odors were “nose-blind” and didn’t perceive a problem (e.g., park ranger regularly sprayed by skunks but didn’t notice lingering smells).
- Insight: cue + reward alone often fails; the routine needs a felt sensation or emotional payoff people will crave.
- Key point: those who need odor removal most don’t recognize they need it, so the habit doesn’t start.
 - Without a noticeable payoff, there’s no craving; the brain needs a tangible signal that “something good happened.”

3. Monkeys

- Lab studies showed habit loops strengthen when a cue predicts a reward and the brain “craves” the payoff.
- Dopamine activity rises at the cue and dips if the expected reward doesn’t arrive—craving drives action.
- Everyday examples: Cinnabon smell, smokers’ urges, phone-check loops; positive habits leverage similar cravings (e.g., post-workout feel-good).
- Takeaway: craving is the engine that powers cues and rewards into stable routines.
 - When the cue appears without the reward, frustration spikes; the loop tightens only when the predicted reward consistently follows.

4. P&G success

- Observation: cleaners feel happiest at the “finished” moment; P&G reframed Febreze as a final touch after cleaning.
- Added a light, pleasant scent to create a satisfying “clean” signal—an immediate, repeatable reward.
- Rebranding emphasized making rooms smell better (not just removing odor), which people could notice and enjoy.
- Outcome: a clear cue (end of cleaning) + gratifying reward (fresh scent) created a craving to spray every time; usage became a habitual “last step.”
- Result in homes: after tidying bedrooms or living rooms, people routinely sprayed a bit of Febreze.

5. Hopkins realization

- Pepsodent’s secret wasn’t the “film” alone; its formula created a noticeable tingle that people craved.
- The tingle became the reward and a self-reinforcing cue—if you don’t feel it, you notice and brush.
- Similar design patterns: shampoo foam, toothpaste froth, textured toothbrushes—engineered sensations that signal “clean” and build craving.
- Lesson: manufactured, reliable sensations make habits sticky by giving the brain something it expects and wants to feel; the sensation becomes the sought-after payoff.
