1. Change only the routine

The Golden Rule of habit change: keep the same cue and the same reward, and insert a new routine. Tony Dungy built winning teams by stripping away complexity so players reacted automatically. Same keys (visual cues) at the snap, same reward (successful stops and wins), but a different, drilled routine that ran faster than opponents’ decisions.

Champions don’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would explain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”

In practice, Dungy taught a few formations and sequenced the keys players already used, removing hesitation. In the Chargers upset, Regan Upshaw and John Lynch followed those keys without thinking—Upshaw’s first steps came from practiced reads; Lynch waited at a preplanned spot and jumped the pass. The routine changed, the cue and reward did not. Ordinary actions, done habitually, became unbeatable.

2. Alcoholics Anonymous, start

AA succeeds by reworking the habit loop around drinking: same cues (stress, boredom, social situations), same rewards (relief, escape, companionship), but a new routine (meetings, calling a sponsor, shared stories). Steps 4–5 force awareness of triggers and payoffs; members then practice alternate routines that deliver the same relief without alcohol.

Research echoes this: even brain stimulation that dulled cravings didn’t keep people sober unless they learned new stress routines (AA, therapy, etc.). The cue and reward remained; durable change came from consistent replacement behaviors.

Mandy’s nail-biting shows the same pattern. Awareness training named the cue (finger tension) and reward (brief physical stimulation). A “competing response” (hands in pockets, gripping a pencil, quick tactile substitute) kept the cue and reward while swapping the routine. With simple tracking, the new routine became automatic and the old habit faded.

3. Belief

Replacement routines often hold—until life gets hard. Under acute stress, people revert unless they believe change is possible. AA’s community fosters that belief: seeing others succeed makes new routines stick when pressure spikes. It isn’t theology that matters so much as the skill of believing—practiced together—so people trust their routines when they need them most.

Dungy’s Bucs and Colts played disciplined football, but in big moments they slipped back. After Jamie Dungy’s death, the Colts’ shared commitment deepened; belief in each other and the system crystallized. In the 2007 AFC Championship, down 21–3, they returned to habits, not heroics, and won—then took the Super Bowl. Belief turned practiced routines into resilient behavior.
